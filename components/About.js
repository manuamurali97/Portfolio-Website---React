            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
              I’m a full-stack developer who enjoys building clean, reliable web applications and solving 
              problems across the stack. I primarily work with JavaScript, TypeScript, PHP, React, and the 
              MERN stack, and I like to create responsive, user-friendly interfaces. I'm also passionate
              about learning new technologies and improving my skills.
            </p>
            <p>
              Alongside web development, I have a strong background in Python and data-oriented 
              problem solving, thanks to my Master's degree in Data Science, which helps me approach challenges analytically and make thoughtful 
              technical decisions. I value writing maintainable code, learning continuously, and 
              building things that are practical, scalable, and easy to use.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I’m not coding, I enjoy reading tech blogs, exploring new frameworks, and contributing
                to open source projects. Something not technical about me is that I love drawing and photography!
            </p>
            <p>
                If you're looking for a dedicated developer who is eager to learn and grow, or just want to connect, feel free to reach out!
            </p>
